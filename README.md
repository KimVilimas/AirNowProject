## What is AirNow?
From their [documentation](https://docs.airnowapi.org/docs/MonitoringSiteFactSheet.pdf): "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) nationwide, voluntary program, AirNow (www.airnow.gov), provides real-time air quality data and forecasts to protect public health across the United States, Canada, and parts of Mexico. AirNow receives real-time ozone and PM2.5 data from over 2,500 monitors and collects air quality forecasts for more than 500 cities."

## Why am I working with AirNow data?
I am working with AirNow data because after surveying different air quality data sources, this seems to be the most credible source which provides the data pretty easily. I am personally invested in issues of air quality because I have asthma and the air quality is heavily tied to my quality of life. 

AirNow provides an API, and I wanted to use this to both practice data science, as well as attempt to improve my own life personally with data applications.

## AirNow's Data Use Disclaimer
"All data provided by AirNow API are made possible by the efforts of more than 150 local, state, tribal, provincial, and federal government agencies (www.airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=airnow.partnerslist). These data are not fully verified or validated; they should be considered preliminary and are subject to change. Data and information reported to AirNow from federal, state, local, and tribal agencies are for the express purpose of reporting and forecasting the Air Quality Index (AQI).Therefore, they should not be used to formulate or support regulation, trends, guidance, or any other government or public decision making. Official regulatory air quality data must be obtained from EPA’s Air Quality System (AQS) (https://www.epa.gov/aqs).
