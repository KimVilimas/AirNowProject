## What is AirNow?
From their [site](https://www.airnow.gov/about-airnow/): "AirNow reports air quality using the official U.S. Air Quality Index (AQI), a color-coded index designed to communicate whether air quality is healthy or unhealthy for you. When you know the AQI in your area, you can take steps to protect your health."

"AirNow is a partnership of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Park Service, NASA, Centers for Disease Control, and tribal, state, and local air quality agencies. Agencies all over the country send their monitoring data to AirNow for display. The Department of State provides data from U.S. Embassies and Consulates to inform personnel and citizens overseas, and the U.S. Forest Service and NOAA provide fire and smoke data."

## Why am I working with AirNow data?
I am working with AirNow data because after surveying different air quality data sources, this seems to be the most credible source which provides the data pretty easily. I am personally invested in issues of air quality because I have asthma and the air quality is heavily tied to my quality of life. 

AirNow provides an API, and I wanted to use this to both practice data science, as well as attempt to improve my own life personally with data applications.
